homeBerry
=========

Bored of getting up to open the door for your cat and then realizing that the cat is just messing with you?
Bored of feeding your cat and see him watching you like saying "yes, I'm your boss bitch" ?
With homBerry automation system now you can leave him outside without even moving from your couch !!

Well at the moment no code is written and no hardware is implemented, so your cat will still laughing at you.

The idea is to control a home form a web interface using a rasberryPi as server and n microcontrollers to do the dirty job like taking temperatures, pressures, swiching things (such as ligths, doors, windows,...) and whatever you want.

The comunication is done over a i2c network wich is nice because is cheap, reliable, only has 2 wires, is multimaster and also is directlly implemented on the rasPi and a lot of microcontrollers like atmegas or PICs.

The raspi also will host a website to control and read values from the microcontrollers.

That's all at the moment and also no one will read this so I'm actually talking to myself.
